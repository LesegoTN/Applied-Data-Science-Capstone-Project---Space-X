# Applied-Data-Science-Capstone-Project---Space-X
In this capstone project, I will take on the role of a data scientist working for a new rocket company called Space Y. The task is to determine the price of each launch and predict if SpaceX will reuse the first stage using machine learning and public information.

## Overview of the DataSet
SpaceX has gained worldwide attention for a series of historic milestones.

It is the only private company ever to return a spacecraft from low-earth orbit, which it first accomplished in December 2010. SpaceX advertises Falcon 9 rocket launches on its website with a cost of 62 million dollars wheras other providers cost upward of 165 million dollars each, much of the savings is because Space X can reuse the first stage.

Therefore if we can determine if the first stage will land, we can determine the cost of a launch.

This information can be used if an alternate company wants to bid against SpaceX for a rocket launch.

This dataset includes a record for each payload carried during a SpaceX mission into outer space.
